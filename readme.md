feature in this project:
1- use flexbox & grid system in css
2- use import & export feature in js 
3- use svg icons to avoid cdns "https://flowbite.com/icons/"
4- <script src="cart.js" type="module"></script> allows you to take advantage of ECMAScript modules,
 which offer better encapsulation, dependency management, and asynchronous loading capabilities compared
  to classic scripts loaded with <script src="cart.js"></script>
